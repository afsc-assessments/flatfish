# 2018 model runs

"Bug 2018 model" directory has tpl datafile etc to reproduce the error shown
in the 2018 and 2019 models

"fixed 2018 model" contains the corrected runs with the model used in 2018.
"newmod matches..." updates the files so that the new (most recent) version 
of the tpl in 2020 (and used for the survey reduction study) 

old18 is a random collection of files...
