# Northern rocksole sole directory

fm.dat in directory gives "model_name" as one word (no spaces) and datafile locale and name. 
This was previously in mod.ctl files. it's like "starter.ss"

| fm.dat          | Datafile containing run name and datafile string (e.g., nrs18_fixed.dat)      |
| nrs18_fixed.dat |MAIN datafile (pointed to by fm.dat |
| mod.ctl    |control file containing a number of options (use R now for changing?) |
| fut_temp.dat |  Research aspect to use future temperatures or other index in projections |
| README.md    |  This file  |

## Notes on proceeding from the 2018 assessment

    1.  Copy the contents of "orig" directory to a new folder    
		
		2.  modify that folder contents, e.g., update 2018 datafile to 2020      
		
		2.  Run model, make a script to do so, modify w/ more scripts, more directories...
