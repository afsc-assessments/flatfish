go into the m21 and then type
"make"
This uses the Makefile.
mod.ctl is used.
fm.dat is where the datafile is actually being referenced.

for mcmc, go to the directory and type make mcmc.
Then to complete it, ./fm -mceval in that directory.

If you get large odd files like unbounded.rep or rwm_lp.txt, just delete them.

Be sure to put large data download files in your /Documents directory.
