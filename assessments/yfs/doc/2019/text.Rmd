### Changes in the assessment methods

Explored incorporating survey start date and its interaction term with annual
bottom water temperature in the survey catchability equation.  


## Summary of BSAI yellowfin sole results

The assessment updates last year’s with results and management quantities that
are lower than the 2017 assessment primarily due to 1) the 2018 survey biomass
point estimate is 32% lower than the 2017 estimate and 2) the assessment model
estimated a slightly lower survey catchability.  Yellowfin sole continue to be
well-above BMSY and the annual harvest remains below the ABC level.  The
female spawning stock is in a slow downward trend.  Management quantities are
given below for the current base model (Model 14_1) and a new base model


## Response to SSC and Plan Team comments

### General comments 

In this section, we list new or outstanding comments on assessments in general
from the last full assessment in 2017. 

_“The SSC recommends that, for those sets of environmental and fisheries observations that support the inference of an impending severe decline in stock biomass, the issue of concern be brought to the SSC, with an integrated analysis of the indices in future stock assessment cycles. To be of greatest value, to the extent possible, this information should be presented at the October Council meeting so that there is sufficient time for the Plan Teams and industry to react to the possible reduction in fishing opportunity.” (SSC October 2017)_

To facilitate a coordinated response to this request, the co-chairs and
coordinators of the BSAI and GOA Groundfish Plan Teams, with concurrence from
stock assessment program leadership at the AFSC, have suggested that authors
address it by using the previous year’s Ecosystem Status Report (ESR) as
follows:

_“No later than the summer of each year, the lead author of each assessment
should review the previous year’s ESR and determine whether any factor or
set of factors described in that ESR implies an impending severe decline in
stock/complex biomass, where “severe decline” means a decline of at least
20% (or any alternative value that may be established by the SSC), and where
biomass is measured as spawning biomass for Tiers 1-3 and survey biomass as
smoothed by the standard Tier 5 random effects model for Tiers 4-5. If an
author determines that an impending severe decline is likely and if that
decline was not anticipated in the most recent stock assessment, he or she
should summarize that evidence in a document that will be reviewed by the
respective Team in September of that year and by the SSC in October of that
year, including a description of at least one plausible mechanism linking
the factor or set of factors to an impending severe decline in biomass, and
also including an estimate or range of estimates regarding likely impacts on
ABC. In the event that new survey or relevant ESR data become available
after the document is produced but prior to the October Council meeting of
that year, the document should be amended to include those data prior to its
review by the SSC, and the degree to which they corroborate or refute the
predicted severe decline should be noted, with the estimate or range of
estimates regarding likely impacts on ABC modified in light of the new data
as necessary.”_

_Stock assessment authors are encouraged to work with ESR analysts to identify
a small subset of indicators prior to analysis, and preferably based on
mechanistic hypotheses.” (SSC October 2018)_

It has been demonstrated that annual bottom water temperature is at least a partial determinate of yellowfin sole late spring/summertime distribution.  However it is unclear how temperature is related to the productivity of the stock.  This species does not rely on ocean/atmosphere advective properties but instead migrates directly to nursery areas to spawn, so may be more resilient to changing ocean conditions.  We also know that somatic growth is positively related to bottom temperature that may result in increased fecundity.  Stock assessment authors would welcome the chance to work with an ESR analysist to think about indicators.

_The SSC also recommends explicit consideration and documentation of ecosystem
and stock assessment status for each stock ... during the December Council
meeting to aid in identifying stocks of concern.” (SSC October 2017)_

Clarification during December 2017 SSC meeting and then re-clarified during June 2018 SSC meeting. In the interest of efficiency, the clarification from the December 2017 minutes is not included here. The relevant portion of the clarification from the June 2018 minutes reads as follows:
“This request was recently clarified by the SSC by replacing the terms ‘ecosystem status’ and ‘stock assessment status’ with ‘Ecosystem Status Report information’ and ‘Stock Assessment Information,’ where the potential determinations for each will consist of ‘Okay’ and ‘Not Okay,’ and by issuing the following guidance:
• The SSC clarifies that ‘stock assessment status’ is a fundamental requirement of the SAFEs and is not really very useful to this exercise, because virtually all stocks are never overfished nor is overfishing occurring.
• Rather the SSC suggests that recent trends in recruitment and stock abundance could indicate warning signs well before a critical official status determination is reached. It may also be useful to consider some sort of ratio of how close a stock is to a limit or target reference point (e.g., B/B35). Thus, additional results for the stock assessments will need to be considered to make the ‘Okay’ or ‘Not Okay’ determinations.
• The SSC retracts its previous request for development of an ecosystem status for each stock/complex. Instead, while considering ecosystem status report information, it may be useful to attempt to develop thresholds for action concerning broad-scale ecosystem changes that are likely to impact multiple stocks/complexes.
• Implementation of these stock and ecosystem determinations will be an iterative process and will require a dialogue between the stock assessment authors, Plan Teams, ecosystem modelers, ESR editors, and the SSC.”
“The Teams recommend that the terms ‘current and future ecosystem condition’ and ‘current and future stock condition’ be used in place of ‘ESR information’ and ‘stock assessment information’.” (Plan Team September 2018)
“The SSC recognized that because formal criteria for these categorizations have not been developed by the PT, they will not be presented in December 2018.” (SSC October 2018)
The iterative process described in the final bullet above was scheduled to begin at the September 2018 meeting of the Joint BSAI and GOA Plan Teams. However, no formal criteria for these categorizations were developed by the Plan Teams in September 2018. As specified by the SSC in October, we will not provide determinations for yellowfin sole at this time and will provide determinations when formal criteria are established. 
“The Team recommended that the authors simply report in words or a table whether catches exceed ABC as an indicator for “partial update” stocks. (Plan Team November 2017)
Does not apply to yellowfin sole SAFE report since it is not a “partial update stock”.
“The SSC reminds authors of the need to balance the desire to improve model fit with increased risk of model misspecification.” (SSC December 2017)
Clarification: “In the absence of strict objective guidelines, the SSC recommends that thorough documentation of model evaluation and the logical basis for changes in model complexity be provided in all cases.” (SSC June 2018)
Important point as the 2018 yellowfin sole assessment has increased the number of parameters estimated by 2 to improve fit to survey biomass.  Hopefully our model evaluation is sound by providing a mechanism for the increased complexity from a new paper on availability/temperature correlations.
 “Report a consistent metric (or set of metrics) to describe fish condition among assessments and ecosystem documents where possible.” (SSC December 2017)
We do not yet report fish condition for yellowfin sole. However, if we do report this metric in the future then we will be consistent with the weight-length residual approach to report fish condition as described in the Ecosystem Status Report. 
“Projections ... clearly illustrate the lack of uncertainty propagation in the ‘proj’ program used by assessment authors. The SSC encourages authors to investigate alternative methods for projection that incorporate uncertainty in model parameters in addition to recruitment deviations. Further, the SSC noted that projections made on the basis of fishing mortality rates (Fs) only will tend to underestimate the uncertainty (and perhaps introduce bias if the population distribution is skewed). Instead, a two-stage approach that first includes a projection using F to find the catch associated with that F and then a second projection using that fixed catch may produce differing results that may warrant consideration.” (SSC December 2017)
Please see model evaluation section for alternative Tier 1 projection with uncertainty in F.
“The Teams recommend that the appropriate use, or non-use, of new model based estimates in this assessment cycle be left to individual authors’ discretion. The Teams further recommend that, if an author chooses to incorporate these into the assessment, the assessment should also contain appropriate comparative models and a full set of diagnostics.” (Plan Team September 2018) 
“The SSC supports the PT recommendation to make the use of model-based survey estimates at the individual author’s discretion for 2018.” (SSC October 2018)
This assessment did not utilize any model based survey estimates. In the future, model-based estimates produced by the Groundfish Assessment Program (GAP) will be used to fit the assessment model as a contrast to the current use of survey estimates. A working group was formed to investigate criteria for use of the model-based estimates in a variety of groundfish life histories. We will consult the guidelines from this working group for determining the usefulness of the model-based estimates for yellowfin sole when they become available. 
“The SSC also noted that, in order to save resources, authors should not conduct additional assessments beyond the prioritized schedule unless they specifically trigger one or more of the criteria identified.” (SSC October 2018)
Yellowfin sole is a Tier 1 stock assessment conducted every year and as such it’s frequency for completion is not determined by a specific external criteria.


### Comments specific to this assessment
SSC and Plan Team 2017 minutes:


_The Team recommends plotting the estimated spawning biomass trajectory with a
fixed pair of M and q values that reduces the retrospective pattern (e.g.,
M=0.09 and q=1.0) on top of the estimated spawning biomass trajectory, with
confidence intervals, from the base model run. This comparison will help to
determine if the different combination of M and q values is within the
estimated uncertainty of the base model, or is describing a completely
different population size._

Please see Retrospective Analysis section of this report.
 The M=0.09 and q=1.0 retrospective model runs are outside the confidence intervals of the assessment model spawning biomass trajectory for about a 17 year period from 1978-1995.  Otherwise it is generally within the uncertainty of the assessment model results.
The Team recommends continuing to explore the retrospective patterns in relation to values of M and q, with fixed values of M and fixed values of q, reporting values of Mohn’s rho for each combination (range to be decided by the authors). Additionally, using those same model runs, report the total likelihood for each combination to create a bivariate likelihood profile for those parameters. Realizing that this will require a considerable number of model runs, the Team leaves it up to the authors to decide whether using the model runs done for the 2017 assessment will suffice, or if important differences arise from a 2018 model that warrant redoing those model runs.
One ongoing concern with the assessment is a strong retrospective pattern in female spawning biomass, whereby more recent assessments tend to yield higher biomass estimates (Figure 4.21). Pursuant to requests by the Plan Team and SSC, the authors explored the effects of M and q on these patterns. Lower values of q and M resulted in better retrospective patterns and lower Mohn’s test statistics. The SSC supports the Plan Team’s recommendation to select a parameterization (e.g., M=0.09 and q=1.0) that reduces the retrospective pattern and to determine whether spawning biomass projections from this parameterization fall within the uncertainty of the base model or if it describes different population trends. The SSC also endorses the Plan Team’s recommendation to continue to explore effects of M and q on the retrospective patterns in biomass. 
The M-q analysis of 2017 was repeated in 2018 but focused on the pattern of model fit (-log likelihood) instead of Mohn’s test statistic and indicated that the best fit to the stock assessment model occurs at M and q values higher than where the best retrospective pattern occurs.  
The SSC notes that potential improved performance of the model with lower values of M are interesting, given that M appears to have been well specified both outside the model (based on multiple methods of estimation, including analysis of old Japanese pair trawl effort data) as well as inside the model (profile of M over a range of values). A natural mortality value of 0.12 is used for both sexes in the base model. Pending the outcome of efforts to explore effects of M and q on the retrospective pattern, the SSC recommends that the authors reexamine alternative methods and data available to estimate M independent of the model in attempts to independently “validate” the plausibility of the results. 
Natural mortality modeling was not attempted in 2018 but can be done in 2019, for both sex-specific M and also time-varying M.
The SSC notes that there appears to be a strong time trend in the proportion of fish in the final age bin (age 17+) in the fishery catch at age data for both males and females (Table 4.4). Prior to 1980, there were no fish in this category. This proportion has generally increased from the mid 1980s to a maximum of 19% for males in 2004 and 23% for females in 1999, and fluctuated at relatively high levels through 2016. Such a pattern could be consistent with time-varying M, although there may be other explanations. For next year’s assessment, the SSC recommends that the assessment authors consider the evidence for time-varying M and evaluate the ability of time-varying M to address the retrospective biomass pattern in an alternative model.
The pattern of increasing proportion of fish in the plus group for our time-series can also be explained by overfishing the stock in the early 1960s by foreign fleets where the yellowfin sole stock was reduced to very low levels and the larger fish were mostly gone.  By 1980 the age 15+ fish were beginning to accumulate in the population again and increased thereafter (to the present) with more prudent management.


# Introduction

## General

The yellowfin sole (_Limanda aspera_) is one of the most abundant flatfish
species in the eastern Bering Sea (EBS) and currently is the target of the
largest flatfish fishery in the world.  They inhabit the EBS shelf and are
considered one stock.  Abundance in the Aleutian Islands region is negligible.

Yellowfin sole are distributed in North American waters from off British
Columbia, Canada, (approx. lat. 49o N) to the Chukchi Sea (about lat. 70o N)
and south along the Asian coast off the South Korean coast in the Sea of Japan
(to about lat. 35o N).  Adults exhibit a benthic lifestyle and occupy separate
winter, spawning and summertime feeding distributions on the eastern Bering
Sea shelf.  From over-winter grounds near the shelf margins, adults begin a
migration onto the inner shelf in April or early May each year for spawning
and feeding.  The directed fishery historically occurred from winter through
autumn (Wilderbuer et al. 1992).  Yellowfin sole are managed as a single stock
in the BSAI management area as there is presently no evidence of stock
structure.
 

## Review of Life History 

In the EBS pollock spawn generally in the period
March-May and in relatively localized regions during specific periods (Bailey
2000). Generally spawning begins nearshore north of Unimak Island in March and
April and later near the Pribilof Islands (Jung et al. 2006, Bacheler et al.
2010). Females are batch spawners with up to 10 batches of eggs per female per
year. Eggs and larvae of EBS pollock are planktonic for a period of about 90
days and appear to be sensitive to environmental conditions. These conditions
likely affect their dispersal into favorable areas (for subsequent separation
from predators) and also affect general food requirements for over-wintering
survival (Gann et al. 2015, Heintz et al., 2013, Hunt et al. 2011, 
Ciannelli et al. 2004). Duffy-Anderson et al. (2015) provide a
review of the early life history of EBS pollock.

Throughout their range juvenile pollock feed on a variety of planktonic
crustaceans,  including calanoid copepods and euphausiids. In the EBS shelf
region, one-year-old pollock are found throughout the water column, but also
commonly occur in the NMFS bottom trawl survey. Ages 2 and 3 year old pollock
are rarely caught in summer bottom trawl survey gear and are more common in
the  midwater zone as detected by mid-water acoustic trawl surveys. Younger
pollock are  generally found in the more northern parts of the survey area and
appear to move to the southeast as they age (Buckley et al. 2009).
Euphausiids, principally _Thysanoessa inermis_ and _T. raschii_, are among the
most important prey items for pollock in the Bering Sea (Livingston, 1991;
Lang et al., 2000; Brodeur et al., 2002; Cianelli et al., 2004; Lang et al.,
2005).  Pollock diets become more piscivorous with age, and cannibalism has
been commonly observed in this region. However, Buckley et al. (2016) showed
spatial patterns of pollock foraging by size of predators. For example, the
northern part of the the shelf region between the 100 and 200 m isobaths
(closest to the shelf break) tends to be more piscivorous than counterparts in
other areas.


## Stock structure

Data from the survey work in the Northern Bering Sea (NBS) region (north of
Nunivak Island to the Russian convention line and into Norton Sound) from 2017
and 2018, as shown below and evaluated in the appendix, suggests that there
are concentrations of pollock present which contrasts with the 2010 survey
when relatively few pollock were present. The pattern of temperatures in the
region likely affect the pollock distribution in ways that likely vary over
time.  However, there is evidence of a relationship between mean bottom
temperatures in the US zone on the EBS shelf and subsequent biomass estimates
in the  Navarin basin (the Russian area adjacent to the Convention Line; e.g.,
Stepanenko and Gritsay 2018,  Ianelli et al. 2015). Some genetic samples were
taken from pollock and collections continue. Pending funding availability,
analysis of these samples could  help ascertain the extent that these fish are
related to those observed in the normal EBS shelf survey area.   Genetic
samples taken from the 2017 summer bottom trawl survey from the Northern
Bering Sea can be compared with samples from the standard Bering Sea Unimak,
Pribilof, Bogoslof, and Zhemchug. This planned study should help improve stock
structure evaluation (last done in Ianelli et al. 2015).


# Fishery  
## Description of the directed fishery 

Yellowfin sole have annually been caught with bottom trawls on the Bering Sea shelf since the fishery began in 1954 and were overexploited by foreign fisheries in 1959-62 when catches averaged 404,000 t annually (Fig. 4.1, top panel).  As a result of reduced stock abundance, catches declined to an annual average of 117,800 t from 1963-71 and further declined to an annual average of 50,700 t from 1972-77.  The lower yield in this latter period was partially due to the discontinuation of the U.S.S.R. fishery.  In the early 1980s, after the stock condition had improved, catches again increased reaching a peak of over 227,000 t in 1985.  

During the 1980s, there was also a major transition in the characteristics of the fishery.  Yellowfin sole were traditionally taken exclusively by foreign fisheries and these fisheries continued to dominate through 1984.  However, U.S. fisheries developed rapidly during the 1980s in the form of joint ventures, and during the last half of the decade began to dominate and then take all of the catch as the foreign fisheries were phased out of the EBS.  Since 1990, only domestic harvesting and processing has occurred.  

The management of the yellowfin sole fishery changed significantly in 2008 with the implementation of Amendment 80 to the BSAI Fisheries Management Plan.  The Amendment directly allocated fishery resources among BSAI trawl harvesters in consideration of their historic harvest patterns and future harvest needs in order to improve retention and utilization of fishery resources by the non-AFA trawl catcher/processor fleet.  This was accomplished by extending the groundfish retention standards to all H&G vessels and also by providing the ability to form cooperatives within the newly formed Amendment 80 sector.  In addition, Amendment 80 also mandated additional monitoring requirements which included observer coverage on all hauls, motion-compensating scales for weighing samples, flow scales to obtain accurate catch weight estimates for the entire catch, no mixing of hauls and no on-deck sorting.  The partitioning of TAC and PSC (prohibited species catch) among cooperatives has significantly changed the way the annual catch has accumulated (Fig 4.1, bottom panel) and the rate of target catch per bycatch ton. There is now a more even and slow attainment of the annual catch relative to the pre-Amendment 80 fishing behavior.  

Yellowfin sole are usually headed and gutted, frozen at sea, and then shipped to Asian countries for further processing (AFSC 2016).  The first wholesale value of Alaska yellowfin sole totaled $97.8 million in 2014.  From 2016 to 2017 the first wholesale price of all Bering Sea flatfish fisheries increased 16% to $192.9 million t and yellowfin sole price increased 19% year over year. In 2010, following a compr,ehensive assessment process, the yellowfin sole fishery was certified under the Marine Stewardship Council environmental standard for sustainable and well-managed fisheries.  The certification also applies to all the major flatfish fisheries in the BSAI and GOA.  The total annual catch (t) since implementation of the MFCMA in 1977 is shown in Table 4.1.

In 2011, federally permitted vessels using non-pelagic trawl gear whose harvest results in flatfish retained catch that is greater than any other retained fishery category were required to use modified trawl gear.  The modifications required the use of elevating devices to raise the section of the trawl warps between the doors and the trawl wing tips by 2.5 inches off the seafloor.  The purpose of the management action was to reduce damage of non-target animals, particularly those that form habitat structure or support other fisheries while not substantially reducing flatfish catch rates or causing gear handling problems (Rose et al. 2010).

The 1997 catch of 181,389 t (retained and discards) was the largest since the fishery became completely domestic but was at lower levels from 1998–2010, averaging 94,004 t (Table 4.2).  From 2011-2014 the catch increased, averaging 155,000 t.  The 2013 catch totaled 165,000 t (73% of the ABC), the highest annual catch in the past 19 years.  For 2018, the catch distribution has been spread out from January through May with the majority coming from 4 BSAI management areas (509, 513, 514, 517).  As of mid-September 2018, the fishing season is ongoing.  In order to estimate the total 2018 catch for the stock assessment model, the average proportion of the 2010-2017 cumulative catch attained by the 35th week of the year (mid-September) was applied to the 2018 catch amount at the same time period and results in a 2018 catch estimate of 146,500 t (53% of the ABC).  The size composition of the 2018 catch for both males and females, from observer sampling, are shown in Figure 4.2, the catch proportions by month and area are shown in Figure 4.3, and maps of the locations where yellowfin sole were caught in 2018, by month (through mid-September), are shown in Figure 4.4.  The average age of yellowfin sole in the 2017 catch is estimated at 12.6 and 13.5 years for females and males, respectively.

The time-series of catch in Table 4.1 also includes yellowfin sole that were discarded in domestic fisheries from 1987 to the present.  Annual discard estimates were calculated from at-sea sampling (Table 4.2).  The rate of discard has ranged from a low of 2% of the total catch in 2012 (and 2015) to 30% in 1992 and is estimated at 3% in the 2017 fishery.  The trend has been toward fuller retention of the catch in recent years, and with the advent of the Amendment 80 harvest practices, discarding is at its lowest level since these estimates have become available.  Historically, discarding primarily occurred in the yellowfin sole directed fishery, with lesser amounts in the Pacific cod, Pollock, rock sole, flathead sole, and “other flatfish” fisheries (Table 4.3).

## Fishery 
### Catch

This assessment uses fishery catch data from 1955- 2018 (shown for 1964-2018
in Table 4.1), including an estimate of the 2018 catch, and fishery
catch-at-age (proportions) from 1964-2017 (Table 4.4, 1975-2017).  The 2017
fishery age composition was primarily composed of fish older than 9 years with
a large amount of 20+ fish.

## Surveys

### Bottom trawl survey (BTS)

Indices of relative abundance available from AFSC surveys have shown a major
increase in the abundance of yellowfin sole during the late 1970s, increasing
from 21 kg/ha in 1975 to 51 kg/ha in 1981 (Fig. 4.2 in Bakkala and Wilderbuer
1990).  These increases have also been documented through Japanese commercial
pair trawl data and catch-at-age modeling in past assessments (Bakkala and
Wilderbuer 1990).

Since 1981, the survey CPUEs have fluctuated widely (Fig. 4.5).  Biomass
estimates for yellowfin sole from the annual bottom trawl survey on the
eastern Bering Sea shelf are shown in Table 4.5 and Figure 4.6.  The data show
a doubling of survey biomass between 1975 and 1979 with a further increase to
over 3.3 million t in 1981.  Total survey abundance estimates fluctuated
erratically from 1983 to 1990 with biomass ranging from as high as 3.5 million
t in 1983 to as low as 1.9 million t in 1986. Biomass estimates since 1990
indicate an even trend at high levels of abundance for yellowfin sole, with
the exception of the results from the 1999 and 2000 summer surveys, which were
at lower levels.  Surveys from 2001-2005 estimated an increase each year but
the estimates since 2006 indicate a stable level with some annual variability.
 However, the 2012 estimate is a 19% decrease from 2011 and the 2013 and 2014
surveys have estimated a 17% increase over 2012.  Similarly, there was a 24%
decrease from 2014 to 2015 followed by a 48% increase from 2015 to 2016, the
highest biomass estimate since 1984. Fluctuations of the magnitude shown
between 1980 and 1990, 1998 and 1999, 2008 and 2009, 2011and 2012,  2014 and
2015 and 2015 and 2016 are unreasonable considering the elements of slow
growth and long life span of yellowfin sole combined with low to moderate
exploitation rate, characteristics which should produce more gradual changes
in abundance.

Variability of yellowfin sole survey biomass estimates (Fig. 4.6) is in part
due to the availability of yellowfin sole to the survey area (Nichol 1998). 
Yellowfin sole are known to undergo annual migrations from wintering areas off
the shelf-slope break to near shore waters where they spawn throughout the
spring and summer months (Nichol, 1995; Wakabayashi, 1989; Wilderbuer et al.,
1992).  Exploratory survey sampling in coastal waters of the eastern Bering
Sea during early summer indicate that yellowfin sole concentrations can be
greater in these shallower areas not covered by the standard AFSC survey than
in the survey proper.  Commercial bottom trawlers have commonly found high
concentrations of yellowfin sole in areas such as near Togiak Bay (Low and
Narita, 1990) and in more recent years from Kuskokwim Bay to just south of
Nunivak Island.  The coastal areas are sufficiently large enough to offer a
substantial refuge for yellowfin sole from the current survey.  

Over the past 18 years, survey biomass estimates for yellowfin sole have shown
a positive correlation with shelf bottom temperatures (Nichol, 1998);
estimates have generally been lower during cold years.   The 1999 survey,
which was conducted in exceptionally cold waters, indicated a decline in
biomass that was unrealistic.  The bottom temperatures during the 2000 survey
were much warmer than in 1999, and the biomass increased, but still did not
approach estimates from earlier years.  Average bottom temperature and biomass
both increased again during the period 2001 – 2003, with the 2003 value the
highest temperature and biomass observed over the 22 year time series up to
that time.  Given that both the 1999 and 2000 surveys were conducted two weeks
earlier than previous surveys, it is possible that the time difference may
also have also affected the availability of yellowfin sole to the survey.  If,
for example, the timing of peak yellowfin sole spawning in nearshore waters
corresponded to the time of the survey, a greater proportion of the population
would be unavailable to the standard survey area.  This pattern was observed
again in 2009 and 2012 when the temperatures and the bottom trawl survey point
estimates were lower.  Summer shelf bottom temperatures in 2012 were the 2nd
coldest recorded by the survey and the time-series and resulted in a 19%
decline from 2011.  In 2016 the Bering Sea had the highest recorded bottom
temperature since measurements began in 1982 and the 2016 estimate of biomass
was the highest in 32 years and 48% higher than the 2015 estimate.  The 2017
survey estimate of 2,787,700 t was 3% lower than 2016, but the 2018 estimate
of 1,892,925 (another warm year) was down 32% from 2017.

We propose two possible reasons why survey biomass estimates are lower during
years when bottom temperatures are low.  First, catchability may be lower
because yellowfin sole may be less active when cold.  Less active fish may be
less susceptible to herding, and escapement under the footrope of survey gear
may increase if fish are less active.  Secondly, bottom temperatures may
influence the timing of the inshore spawning migrations of yellowfin sole and
therefore affect their availability to the survey area (Nichol et al. in
review).  Because yellowfin sole spawning grounds include nearshore areas
outside the survey area, availability of fish within the survey area can vary
with the timing of this migration and the timing of the survey.  In the case
of 2016, a very warm year in the Bering Sea, it appears that a higher portion
of the adult biomass was distributed on the shelf (outside of the spawning
areas) relative to the average of all previous survey years, indicating
earlier spawning migration (Fig 4.7).  

Yellowfin sole population numbers-at-age estimated from the annual bottom
trawl surveys are shown in Table 4.6 and their occurrence in trawl survey
hauls and associated collections of lengths and age structures since 1982 are
shown in Table 4.7.  Their total tonnage caught in the resource assessment
surveys since 1982 are listed in Table 4.8 and also in an appendix table with
IPHC survey catches.

### Northern Bering Sea survey

Trawl survey sampling was extended to the northern Bering Sea in 2010, 2017
and 2018.  The trawl surveys conducted in 2010 and 2017 occupied the same
areas with similar sampling densities.  The 2018 survey was a reduced effort
and only sampled a subset of the northern Bering Sea.  Stations in 2018 were
30 nautical miles apart (instead of 20 nm) and excluded Norton Sound and
inshore areas north of Nunivak Island.  For comparison among years (2010,
2017, 2018), biomass estimates were derived by truncating the areal coverage
of the 2010 and 2017 surveys to include only the area covered in 2018 that was
common to all three surveys, and this was treated as a single stratum (Table
4.5).   This truncated area is 158,286 square kilometers (compared to 200,207
square kilometers in 2010 & 2017).  There was a small increase in the estimate
of yellowfin sole in the truncated survey area from the 3 surveys. Since
yellowfin sole fishing is presently prohibited in the northern Bering Sea, the
biomass from this area is not included in the stock assessment model.

###  Age Determination

Yellowfin sole ages have been determined at the AFSC by using the break and burn method on otoliths collected in surveys and from fisheries since 1979.  In 2016 the age determination methods for yellowfin sole were validated using the bomb-produced uptake measurement of 14C method (Kastelle et al. 2016).

### Length and Weight-at-Age 

Past assessments of yellowfin sole have used sex-specific, time-invariant
growth based on the average length-at-age and weight-at-length relationships
from the time-series of survey observations summed over all years since 1982. 
These weight-at-age estimates were estimated from the following relationships:

Parameters of the von Bertalanffy growth curve have been estimated for
yellowfin sole, by sex, from the trawl survey database as follows: 

                                                              Linf               K            t0                       n
                                 Males                   33.7           0.161      -0.111       656
                       Females               37.8           0.137        0.112       709

A sex-specific length-weight relationship was also calculated from the survey
database using the usual power function, weight (g) =  a Length(cm)b, where a
and b are parameters estimated to provide the best fit to the data (Fig. 4.8).
 

                                                         a                    b                      n
                                      males      0.00854         3.081               2,701
                                      females   0.0054           3.227               3,662

These estimates of weight at length were applied to the annual trawl survey
estimates of population length at age, by sex, to calculate the weight at each
age (Fig. 4.8).  Since the resulting estimates of annual weight-at-age were
highly variable for fish older than 11 years, ages 11-20 were smoothed using a
five year average smoothing method for 1982-2018.

Applications of dendrochronology (tree-ring techniques) have been used to
develop biochronologies from the otolith growth increments of northern rock
sole (Lepidopsetta polyxystra), yellowfin sole and Alaska plaice (Pleuronectes
quadrituberculatus) in the eastern Bering Sea. These techniques ensure that
all growth increments are assigned the correct calendar year, allowing for
estimation of somatic growth by age and year for chronologies that span
approximately 25 years (Matta et al. 2010).  The analysis indicated that
yellowfin sole somatic growth exhibits annual variability and has a strong
positive correlation with May bottom water temperature in the Bering Sea (Fig.
4.9).

The relationship between temperature and growth was further explored by
reanalyzing yellowfin sole growth by age and year.  Length-weight data
collected when obtaining otolith (age) samples in RACE surveys (n=7,000 from
1987, 1994 and 1999-2009) also indicate that weight at age exhibits annual
variability and is highly correlated with summer bottom water temperature
observations with a lag of 2-3 years for the temperature effect to be seen
(shown for age 5 fish in figure 4.10) .  These observations were then extended
back to 1979 using survey population length-at-age estimates (since
weight-at-age is a power function of the length-at-age, Clark et al. 1999,
Walters and Wilderbuer 2000).  

In order to incorporate time-varying (year effect on growth) and
temperature-dependent growth functions into the age-structured stock
assessment model we used the annual observed population mean weight-at-age
(time-varying) from the trawl survey. These empirical data indicate good
somatic growth correspondence with annual bottom temperature anomalies from
1982-2017 (Fig. 4.11).  Fishery weight at age data available from 2008-2016
were averaged across years for each age to provide updated estimates for the
fishery 

### Maturity-at-age

Maturity information collected from yellowfin sole females during the 1992 and
1993 eastern Bering Sea trawl surveys have been used in this assessment for
the past 20 years (Table 4.10).  Nichol (1995) estimated the age of 50%
maturity at 10.5 years based on the histological examination of 639 ovaries. 
Maturity has recently been re-evaluated from a histological analysis of
ovaries collected in 2012 (Table 4.10). Results were very similar to the
earlier study with only a 2% difference in estimates of yellowfin sole female
spawning biomass (TenBrink and Wilderbuer 2015).  In addition, the SSC
requested that the assessment use a maturity schedule that uses estimates
derived from both the 1992 and the 2012 collections (Table 4.10). For
yellowfin sole sexual maturity occurs well after the age of entry into the
fishery.  Yellowfin sole females are 82% selected to the fishery by age 10
whereas they have been found to be only 40% mature at this age. 


#  Analytic approach
##  General model structure

The abundance, mortality, recruitment and selectivity of yellowfin sole were assessed with a stock assessment model using the AD Model Builder language (Fournier et al. 2012; Ianelli and Fournier 1998).  The conceptual model is a separable catch-age analysis that uses survey estimates of biomass and age composition as auxiliary information (Fournier and Archibald 1982).  The assessment model simulates the dynamics of the population and compares the expected values of the population characteristics to the characteristics observed from surveys and fishery sampling programs.  This is accomplished by the simultaneous estimation of the parameters in the model using the maximum likelihood estimation procedure.  The fit of the simulated values to the observable characteristics is optimized by maximizing a log(likelihood) function given some distributional assumptions about the observed data.  
The model starts at age one and fish older than twenty are allowed to accumulate into a plus group. Since the sex-specific weight-at-age for yellowfin sole diverges after age of maturity (about age 10 for 40% of the stock) with females growing larger than males, the current assessment model is coded to accommodate the sex-specific aspects of the population dynamics of yellowfin sole.  The model allows for the input of sex-specific estimates of fishery and survey age composition and weight-at-age and provides sex-specific estimates of population numbers, fishing mortality, selectivity, fishery and survey age composition and allows for the estimation of sex-specific natural mortality and catchability.  The model retains the utility to fit combined sex data inputs.
The suite of parameters estimated by the model are classified by three likelihood components:
Data component  Distributional assumption
Trawl fishery catch-at-age  Multinomial
Trawl survey population age composition Multinomial
Trawl survey biomass estimates and S.E. Log normal
The total log likelihood is the sum of the likelihoods for each data component (Table 4.11).  The likelihood components may be weighted by an emphasis factor, however, equal emphasis was placed on fitting each likelihood component in the yellowfin sole assessment except for the catch. The AD Model Builder software fits the data components using automatic differentiation (Griewank and Corliss 1991) software developed as a set of libraries (AUTODIFF C++ library).  Table 4.11 also presents the key equations used to model the yellowfin sole population dynamics in the Bering Sea and Table 4.12 provides a description of the variables used in Table 4.11.
Sharp increases in trawl survey abundance estimates for most species of Bering Sea flatfish between 1981 and 1982 indicate that the 83-112 trawl was more efficient for capturing these species than the 400-mesh eastern trawl used in 1975, and 1979-81.  Allowing the model to tune to these early survey estimates would most likely underestimate the true pre-1982 biomass, thus exaggerating the degree to which biomass increased during that period.  Although this underestimate would have little effect on the estimate of current yellowfin sole biomass, it would affect the spawner and recruitment estimates for the time-series.  Hence, the pre-1982 survey biomass estimates were omitted from the analysis.
The model of yellowfin sole population dynamics was evaluated with respect to the observations of the time-series of survey and fishery age compositions and the survey biomass trend since 1982. 
Parameters Estimated Outside the Assessment Model
Natural mortality (M) was initially estimated by a least squares analysis where catch at age data were fitted to Japanese pair trawl effort data while varying the catchability coefficient (q) and M simultaneously.  The best fit to the data (the point where the residual variance was minimized) occurred at a M value of 0.12 (Bakkala and Wespestad 1984).  This was also the value which provided the best fit to the observable population characteristics when M was profiled over a range of values in the stock assessment model using data up to 1992 (Wilderbuer 1992).  Since then, natural mortality has been estimated as a free parameter in some of the stock assessment model runs which have been evaluated the past five years.  A natural mortality value of 0.12 is used for both sexes in the base model presented in this assessment.
Yellowfin sole maturity schedules were estimated from in-situ observations from two studies as discussed in a previous section (Table 4.10).
Parameters Estimated Inside the Assessment Model
The parameters estimated by the model are presented below:
Fishing 
mortality Selectivity Survey 
catchability  Year class 
strength  Spawner-
recruit Total
66  268 4 105 2 445

The increase in the number of parameters estimated in this assessment compared to last year (8) can be accounted for by the input of another year of fishery data and the entry of another year class into the observed population, four more sex-specific fishery selectivity parameters and 2 additional catchability parameters.
Year Class Strengths
The population simulation specifies the numbers-at-age in the beginning year of the simulation, the number of recruits in each subsequent year, and the survival rate for each cohort as it moves through the population over time using the population dynamics equations given in Table 4.11.
Selectivity
Fishery and survey selectivity was modeled separately for males and females using the two parameter formulation of the logistic function (Table 4.11).  The model was run with an asymptotic selectivity curve for the older fish in the fishery and survey, but still was allowed to estimate the shape of the logistic curve for young fish.  The oldest year classes in the surveys and fisheries were truncated at 20 and allowed to accumulate into the age category 20+ years.  A single selectivity curve, for both males and females, was fit for all years of survey data.
Given that there have been annual changes in management, vessel participation and most likely gear selectivity, time-varying fishing selectivity curves were estimated. A logistic equation was used to model fishery selectivity and is a function of time-varying parameters specifying the age and slope at 50% selection,  and  , respectively.  The fishing selectivity (Sf) for age a and year t is modeled as, 
 
where ηt and φt are time-varying and partitioned (for estimation) into parameters representing the mean and a vector of deviations (log-scale) conditioned to sum to zero.  The deviations are constrained by a lognormal prior with a variance that was iteratively estimated.  The process of iterating was to first set the variance to a high value (diffuse prior) of 0.52 and estimate the deviations.  The next step was to compare the variability of model estimates.  The variance of the model estimates were then rounded up slightly and fixed for subsequent runs.  The 2016 values were fixed as the average of the 3 most recent years.

### Fishing Mortality
The fishing mortality rates (F) for each age and year are calculated to approximate the catch weight by solving for F while still allowing for observation error in catch measurement.  A large emphasis (300) was placed on the catch likelihood component to force the model to closely match the observed catch.

### Survey Catchability
A past assessment (Wilderbuer and Nichol 2001) first examined the relationship between estimates of survey biomass and bottom water temperature.  To better understand how water temperature may affect the catchability of yellowfin sole to the survey trawl, catchability was estimated for each year in the stock assessment model as:
where q is catchability, T is the average annual bottom water temperature anomaly at survey stations less than 100 m, and α and β are parameters estimated by the model.  The catchability equation has two parts.  The e -α term is a constant or time-independent estimate of q. The second term, eβT  is a time-varying (annual) q which responds to metabolic aspects of herding or distribution (availability) which can vary annually with bottom water temperature.  The result of incorporating bottom temperature to estimate annual q has resulted in an improved fit to the survey (shown in Figure 4.12 for the base model).  
In this assessment we introduce a revised survey catchability model (Model 18_1) where survey start date (expressed as deviation in days (- and +) from the average survey start date of June 4th) and it’s interaction with annual bottom water temperature is added to the catchability equation as:
q=e-α+βT+γS+µT:S
where T=survey bottom temperature (averaged per year for all stations <100 m), S=survey start date, and T:S=interaction of T and S.  Earlier survey start dates usually encounter colder water and since the timing of the survey start date is positively correlated with bottom water temperature, improvement in fitting the survey biomass estimates can be gained by estimating two new parameters (µ and ɤ).  Akaike information criterion (AIC) were used to determine if the additional variables (S and T:S) improved the regression fit.  The improvement in fit was more than offset by the additional two parameters (Nichol et al. In review).

### Spawner-Recruit Estimation
Annual recruitment estimates from 1978-2012 were constrained to fit a Ricker (1958) form of the stock recruitment relationship as follows:
 
where R is age 1 recruitment, S is female spawning biomass (t) the previous year, and α and β are parameters estimated by the model.  The spawner-recruit fitting is estimated in a later phase after initial estimates of survival, numbers-at-age and selectivity are obtained.
